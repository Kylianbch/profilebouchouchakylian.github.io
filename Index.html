        <h2>My Education</h2>
        <img src="Photos/Lycée Marseilleveyre.png" alt="Lycée Marseilleveyre" class="left-centered-img">
        <p>Before Kedge BS, I was in Marseilleveyre Highschool. There, I completed my junior and senior years in social economics, having a strong attraction to this field of study</p>
        <p>After graduating from my baccalauréat ES with honors, I decided to continue my studies at Kedge Business School. I'm doing the Post Bac Bachelor program. There, I learnt the most important basics of business and then specialized in Banking and Finance in my third year</p>
        <p>Then, after obtaining my Master's degree, I decided to move on to the Msc Corporate Finance program, which I'm currently enrolled in.</p>

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Football: This sport is a passion I have had since I was really young. During all my childhood with my friends in school and in the club, I was playing football</p>
        <p>I am also a big fan of Olympique de Marseille and my favorite player there was Boubakar Kamara: He plays in the same position as me: Central Defender Midfield. But now he plays in Premier League in Aston Villa</p>

        <p>House music: I am a huge fan of house music. It's a genre that I got to know not too long ago at a music festival, but I quickly became hooked and now I can't stop listening to it</p>
        <p>In this style of music, I really like artists such as Black Coffee, Fred Again, and ANOTR</p>

        <h2>My Experiences</h2>
        <p>Internship</p>
        <ul>During my university studies, I had the opportunity to work in Barcelona, Spain, as an affiliate manager for 6 months during my 2nd year of a Bachelor's degree in Banking and Finance. During my 3rd year, I then had the opportunity to do an internship in Accounting in order to learn the basics of finance in this sector that I love so much.</ul>
        <p>Student Contract</p>
        <ul>During my school years, I maintained a work experience in parallel to my studies in order to be able to support my tuition fees. To this end, I've been working as a multi-skilled team member at Lidl for nearly 4 years. This student contract taught me a lot of values in the professional world and enabled me to acquire a lot of useful skills</ul>
